This CMS will require to install a web server (**Apache**) and a DB engine (**MySQL**) and some network tweaks.\r\n\r\nThis platform will be deployed with a virtual structure: a Linux host (for instance your laptop) with **KVM** hypervisor, installed in **NAT** mode, allowing to deploy and to host two virtual machines **VM**:\r\n\r\n* `Web Server` **raid-vm01**\r\n* `Database` **raid-vm01**\r\n\r\nVirtual Machine images will be hosted in a **LVM** from host.\r\n\r\nSystem Architecture:\r\n\r\n![Host Guest Virtualization](https://raw.github.com/ricardogarfe/mswl-systems-integration/master/images/final_practice.png)\r\n\r\nNetwork Architecture: Linux Host (Dom-0) will have a private IP (at your choice). Virtual Machines will be inside a private subnet not accessed from outside the network.\r\n\r\nSummarizing, with this practice we will have the following platform:\r\n* Host (Dom-0):  private ip, Xen/KVM server (192.168.122.1) with Linux (such as Debian/Ubuntu)\r\n* `raid-vm01` (DomU): Services (Apache), private ip (192.168.122.80), public access to the ports `80` y `22001`.\r\n* `raid-vm02` (DomU): database (MySQL), private ip (192.168.122.81), accessed to MySQL port from\r\n`raid-vm01`. Public access only to the ssh port `22002`.\r\n\r\n## Extras\r\n\r\nExtra issues to increase score:\r\n\r\n* +2 points: Firewall in **Dom0** to filter/forward packets from outside the network, and it will allow virtual machines to access outside. The firewall has to allow connections to the ports `80`, `22001` and `22002`, forwarding the web requests to the virtual machine with a web server (`raid-vm01`). The firewall will also forward the ssh connections to both virtual machines (via `22001` and `22002` ports).\r\n* +1 point: Virtual Machines will have to mount `LVM filesystems`. So different volumes (LVMs) for different VM mountpoints:\r\n    * `/var/www` volume mounted in `raid-vm01`.\r\n    * `/var/lib/mysql` volume mounted in `raid-vm02`.\r\n\r\n* +1 point: Using `RAID 1`: LVM mounted with two (or more) physical hard disks (for instance two USB flash drives).\r\n* +0.5 point: `HTTPS support` in web server (`raid-vm01`).\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\nCreate a wiki with all documentation extracted from `final_practice` folder in repostiory:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nfinal_practice/\r\n├── 001-logical-disc-layer.rst\r\n├── 002-virtualizacion.rst\r\n├── fstab.rst\r\n├── iptables.rst\r\n├── secure-apache-ssl.rst\r\n├── storage-devices.rst\r\n└── wordpress-mysql-server.rst\r\n```\r\n\r\nWiki [Systems Integration Documentation](https://github.com/ricardogarfe/mswl-systems-integration/wiki).\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" rel=\"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0\">![Foo](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/3.0/88x31.png)</a>\r\n\r\nThis work by Ricardo Gracía Fernández - ricardogarfe [at] gmail [dot] com is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
